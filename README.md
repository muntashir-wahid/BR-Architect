# BR-Architect
It's an architect template inspired by [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp).

## Reason to build this project

I've been learning HTML and CSS from [w3schooles](https://www.w3schools.com). After I finish the basics of the two core technologies of the web application development I have decided to create some templates from their site to practice my knowledge of these two technologies. So I built the template with HTML and CSS.

## Project Description
This is a static one-page website that has no functionality.The page serves some of the projects done by the architect company called **BR Architect** and some information about their employees.

### Used technologies
This project is done with HTML and CSS only.
* I have used some semantics HTML elements.
* I have used CSS Flexbox for laying out the page
